# Biggest decision taken during a project
The biggest decision i have made in my process is to rewrite my api code in python instead of javascript. I was struggling to get info from models.py to the javascript file, to make the requests dynamic instead of hardcoded. I had tried many things, but without any succes. Finaly i had a session with Jelle, he showed me a way to do the same in pyhton, but this required that i had te rewtrite a lot of code. This was my best decision because i am a lot comfortable with connecting things in python than in javascript (which i have never learned). This made it possible to add a lot of functionality to my site.
